\title{Is the object continuous (as opposed to categorical)}
\usage{
isCont(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the object to test}
}
\value{
TRUE if the object is continuous, or is a model built on continuous data, FALSE otherwise
}
\description{
Checks if an object is continuous (or categorical). Currnetly accepts either a vector, presumably from a data frame,
or a model object. In the case of the latter, it will check whether the model was built using continuous data.
}
\details{
Note that it cannot be assume that if a model fails \code{isCont} it will pass \code{\link{isCat}}; both functions test for the
conditions which it expects to hold, and there may be cases in which neither set of conditions is fully met.
}
\examples{
isCont(siteData$ecoType)
isCont(siteData$slope)
\dontrun{
isCont(model)
}

\seealso{
\code{\link{isCat}} for the complementary test.
