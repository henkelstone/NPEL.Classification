\description{
Given that it can be a challenge to build a raster dataset there is a mini dataset included with the package. Due to size limitations it
does not contain very many layers and is limited to only 100 x 100 pixels. However, it is sufficient to illustrate the data format
expected by the package, and it allows for new users to \sQuote{play} with the package. It also facilitates testing of code because it is
so small and code executes relatively quickly.
}
\details{
Given the limitations imposed by the need to have a portable library (read: small enough to easily distribute on over the internet), this
raster is both small and has only a few layers. The layers included are those that fell out of our dimensional analysis as being the most
significant of the Landsat and DEM data. The raw Landsat data is included so that users could generate other derived layers if they
wished; code is provided in the example section. Following is a list of included raster variables:

\itemize{
  \item \code{base_1:7} the base Landsat layers
  \item \code{grnns, wetness, brtns} the so-called \sQuote{Tasseled-Cap} variables; they reflect greenness, wetness, and brightness respectively
  \item \code{dem} the basic elevations from the digital elevation model
  \item \code{slp} slope, as derived from the DEM
  \item \code{asp} aspect, as derived from the DEM; note that different algorithms use different values for NA, a reliable filter is that aspect is NA when slope == 0
  \item \code{hsd} hillshade, a measure of how much light the surface receives -- derived from the DEM
}
}
\note{
Note that to date, the aspect computed in the terrain package does not match that generated by ArcGIS. At the time of writing
  (15.Feb.2015) this difference has still not been resolved. The same issue applies to hillshade (hsd). As ever, use any variable with
  care, and the understanding that it may be flawed.
